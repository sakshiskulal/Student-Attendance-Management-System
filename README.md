# Student-Attendance-Management-System
The Student Attendance Management System is a web-based platform designed to automate the process of recording, tracking, and managing student attendance in educational institutions.
The system replaces traditional manual methods—such as paper registers or Excel sheets—with a fast, accurate, and user-friendly digital solution.
Students, faculty, and administrators are provided with secure login access, ensuring that attendance data is safely stored and easily accessible.
With features like daily attendance marking, attendance percentage calculation, report generation, and low-attendance alerts, the system improves transparency and reduces errors in the attendance process.

This project was developed using industry-standard tools such as Jira, Confluence, and GitHub to demonstrate a complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
Jira was used to plan and track work by creating epics, user stories, tasks, and bugs, ensuring the development process remained organized and efficient. 
Confluence was used to document project plans, requirements, diagrams, and progress updates, providing a central knowledge base.
GitHub handled version control, storing all source code and maintaining a clear commit history linked to Jira issues. 
Together, these tools enabled structured planning, smooth collaboration, and systematic development, resulting in a reliable and well-documented attendance management system.
